### Deployment & Additional Notes

- **Performance & SEO:** Next.js automatically optimizes your pages and supports server-side rendering. Use `<Head>` components within pages if you need to add meta tags for SEO.
- **Accessibility:** The site uses semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS utilities to ensure good contrast and readability.
- **Testing & Tooling:** Consider adding ESLint, Prettier, and unit tests as your project grows.

You can now customize and deploy this project to any production environment (like Vercel, Netlify, or your own server) with minimal adjustments.

This code base meets your requirements by dynamically rendering your resume, showcasing your professional experience and projects, and following modern front-end practices with responsive design and clean, modular code.

Happy coding!
